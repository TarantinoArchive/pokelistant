PokéListant
===========

Pokélistant is a simple, free, ligthweigth and offline Python script to generate Pokémon Tournament teamlists

How does it works?
------------------

TL;DR: just download this, run "pip install pillow" in terminal and execute the main.py file

or

It's pretty simple.
It is written in Python, so you need to install Python. Then, just open a CMD/Powershell instance and write:

`pip install pillow`

Then just download/clone this repository.
If you want to download it just press the green button at the top right (raccomended way), if you want to clone the repository, you have to have Git installed and then run, in a CMD/Powershell instance:

`git clone www.github.com/GianlucaTarantino/pokelistant`

Now, just unzip the compressed archive you have downloaded and run the main.py file, with double clicking it or with:

`python main.py`

with a CMD/Powershell instance in the Python file directory

Now just paste there your Showdown teamlist and admire your list.jpg file perfectly compiled!

### It's too difficult for me, is there a more simple way?

Yeah, i'm working on a .exe of this program that you simply download and execute.
I'm also working on a web based version of this.
So just, don't worry (anyway it is really simple, give it a try!)
